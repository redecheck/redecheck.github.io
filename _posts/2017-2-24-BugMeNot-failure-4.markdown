## About Distinct RLF 9 {#About-drlf}

The search bar doesnâ€™t resize fluidly as the viewport narrows and the header becomes too small to fit both the logo and the search bar side-by-side. This causes the search bar to overflow the header. To remedy the fault, the developer should either use fluid sizing on the search bar when the viewport is narrow to make sure there is always enough room, or use a media query to adjust the layout of the two elements in relation to one other. The failure manifests for a large number of viewport widths, so should be fairly easy to detect using a manual approach.

Here is the form overflowing the header:

Once the viewport is wide enough, the form can correctly fit inside the header:
![OK](assets/good-bad/rlf9/ok.png){: .center-image}
