  <p>ReDeCheck (REsponsive DEsign CHECKer, pronounced “Ready Check”) is an automated tool designed to aid developers during the process of testing the layouts of responsive (i.e., "mobile ready") web sites. With the huge range of devices currently available, performing adequate quality assurance on a sufficient range of devices is extremely difficult, if not impossible. Yet, since it is important to have a high-quality mobile-ready web site, ReDeCheck makes responsive web testing both efficient and effective!
